#A company sample page built with Flexbox

##General info 

A responsive page based on Flexbox developed during workshops at the Coder's Lab front-end course - it is based on a provided design in a PSD file. 
Images sliced by me. 

It employs some simple JS/jQuery scroll / click functions, BX Slider, Lightbox2 gallery and more.

##The Code

Here you will find the source code written by me. To enjoy the page fully you will need to compile Sass files into CSS and employ BX Slider and Lightbox2 jQuery libraries. 

Modifications:

* right and left arrows removed on BX Slider

* Lightbox positioning from top is increased by 0.02*top
